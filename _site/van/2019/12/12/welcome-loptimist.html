    <p>In July 2018, I bought a van from a New Hampshire guy who had just come back from a year-long adventure climbing out West and in Mexico. He had already built out the interior, so all I had to do in addition to mechanical maintenance was revamp some of the existing structures and adding some features I wanted, like a sink.</p>

<p>Just like that, L’Optimist was (re)born!</p>

<p>L’Optimist is named after the small boats that I learned to sail on in France, called “optimists”. It also appeals to optimism, which the old van and I will need in our plan to make it to Alaska in the spring of 2020.</p>
