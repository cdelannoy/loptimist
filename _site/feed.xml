He had already built out the interior, so all I had to do in addition to mechanical maintenance was revamp some of the existing structures and adding some features I wanted, like a sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like that, L’Optimist was (re)born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’Optimist is named after the small boats that I learned to sail on in France, called “optimists”. It also appeals to optimism, which the old van and I will need in our plan to make it to Alaska in the spring of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
